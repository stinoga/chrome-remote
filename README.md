chrome-remote
=============

Bash script for debugging a page on mobile Chrome. Will open any available tabs you have from your device, and let you inspect them with developer tools.

Prerequisites
--------------
1. Install android-sdk (I use [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) to install).
2. Enable USB debugging on your device (Steps [here](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging#enable-usb-debugging)).
3. Connect your device to your computer via USB.

After that, just run the script:
